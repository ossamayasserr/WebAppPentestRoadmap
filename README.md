a Professional Web Application Penetration Tester

## Before Starting

### Prerequisites

- **Good English ( Reading and Listening )**
- **Researching Skills ( Use Google when you face any problem )**
- **Some Notes to Keep in Mind.**
    - You should study continuously if you are a beginner or even an expert, every day there are new updates in many technologies and new techniques are discovered.
    - All links provided are my recommendation which may not be the best for everyone, so you could change any of them if you found a better resource.

### Important Q&A

1. What do we learn in the first stage(Pre-Security)?
    
    We will learn the core skills that are needed to be a Penetration Tester, those skills are also the core skills for many IT Jobs.
    
2. Is this the best roadmap for a Penetration Tester?
    - You should know that the Cyber Security path is not easy and it takes time and there is no clear path for it that makes you an expert.
    - Keep in mind that the difficulty you face while learning is the same as others so all of us will struggle with being better in this field(we are equal).
